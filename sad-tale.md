House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

He overthew the corrupt officials and maniacal child king and the kingdom lived happily ever after.
At least until the White Walkers came.
